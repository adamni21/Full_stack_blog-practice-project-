# A Full Stack Blog

## Intro

This is a practice/portfolio project of mine. 

## Current Functionality

The homepage shows a introduction of the blog, followed by article previews (paginated) with a link to the full article/post.

You can write new articles on a "hidden" url-extension "/.new_article" where you enter: title, content/body and choose an existing author from a dropdown.
You can preview the article or upload when finished.

You can't add an author from the frontend yet. (new frontend coming next)

### Roadmap

In order of planned implementation:

- New Frontend

- Authorization (Front- and Backend)

- Article Filtering

- Administration Permition/Clearance
